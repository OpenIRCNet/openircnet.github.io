The mission of OpenIRC is to provide everyone a safe place to chat, learn new things, collaborate, and have fun. In order to achieve our mission, it is imperative that we establish some basic ground rules for you and your community to follow while on our network.

## Spam
Spam is nothing but disruptive, annoying, and harmful to the atmosphere of the community. This includes sending unsolicited messages to other users, sending large amounts of messages in a short period of time (flooding), or advertising products, channels, and other networks in places where they are not wanted. OpenIRC utilizes automated systems to prevent and stop spam on the network. In the event that you are affected by one of these systems in error, please email [kline@openirc.club](mailto:kline@openirc.club) to request assistance. If you are facing issues with spam, please reach out to a member of our staff team.

## Harassment
Harassment has no place on OpenIRC. Forms of harassment include (but are not limited to) hate speech based on race, religion, political views, or making threats to other users. If you feel that you are being harassed by another user, please reach out to a member of our staff team or email [support@openirc.club](mailto:support@openirc.club).

## Ban evasion
OpenIRC has a zero-tolerance policy for ban evasion. If you are banned from a channel, you are expected to honor that ban. Any attempts to circumvent a ban can result in a network wide ban. If a user in your channel is ban evading, please reach out to a member of our staff team or email [support@openirc.club](mailto:support@openirc.club).

If you see behavior that violates these guidelines, please contact our staff team or email [support@openirc.club](mailto:support@openirc.club). Do bear in mind that OpenIRC staff have an obligation to advise law enforcement of any unlawful activity or situations where there is a credible threat to someone's life.
