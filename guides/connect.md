OpenIRC can be accessed via our [webchat](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/?settings=02b7dd3c6ad18673736cf637e46239ab) client or using a traditional IRC client like Weechat or irssi. Note that webchat is not recommended for long-term usage. To connect to OpenIRC with your client, simply use `irc.openirc.club` as the server name. We support plain text connections on the ports 6665-6667 and TLS connections on port 6697. In order for TLS to work properly, you must be connecting to `irc.openirc.club`.
